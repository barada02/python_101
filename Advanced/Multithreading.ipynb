    "Using the `threading` module:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_hello():\n",
    "    print(\"Hello from thread!\")\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "# Start the thread\n",

    "\n",
    "# Wait for the thread to finish\n",
    "t.join()\n",
    "```\n",
    "This runs the `print_hello` function in a separate thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 3: Using Multiple Threads**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_numbers():\n",
    "    for i in range(5):\n",
    "        print(f\"Number: {i}\")\n",

    "print(\"Both threads finished execution.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Threads will run concurrently, though the order of execution may vary.\n",

    "### **Step 4: Thread Synchronization Using Locks**\n",
    "When multiple threads modify shared data, synchronization is necessary to prevent race conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import threading\n",
    "import time\n",

    "\n",

    "print(\"Final Counter:\", counter)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Without `lock`, `counter` may not be accurate due to race conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 5: Using Thread Pool Executor**\n",
    "The `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` makes it easier to manage multiple threads.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor\n",
    "\n",
    "def square(n):\n",
    "    return n * n\n",
    "\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3) as executor:\n",
    "    results = executor.map(square, numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(list(results))\n",
    "```\n",
    "It automatically manages thread creation and execution.\n",
    "\n",
