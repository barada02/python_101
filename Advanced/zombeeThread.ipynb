    "### **Zombie Threads in Python**  \n",
    "\n",
    "A **zombie thread** is a thread that has completed execution but remains in the system because it hasn't been properly terminated or joined. These threads consume system resources unnecessarily and can lead to memory leaks or unexpected behavior.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Causes of Zombie Threads**  \n",
    "1. **Not calling `join()`** â€“ If a thread finishes execution but isn't joined, it may remain in a zombie state.  \n",
    "2. **Daemon threads** â€“ Since daemon threads exit when the main program stops, they might not clean up properly.  \n",
    "3. **Uncontrolled loops** â€“ Threads running infinite loops without a proper exit condition can become zombie threads if the main thread stops.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example of a Zombie Thread**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import threading\n",
    "import time\n",
    "\n",
    "def background_task():\n",
    "    while True:\n",
    "        print(\"Running...\")\n",
    "        time.sleep(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "t = threading.Thread(target=background_task)\n",
    "t.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "time.sleep(3)\n",
    "print(\"Main program exits\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "ðŸ’¡ Here, `background_task` keeps running **even after the main program exits**, making it a zombie thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How to Prevent Zombie Threads**\n",
    "1. **Use `join()` to properly terminate threads**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   t.join()  # Ensures thread exits cleanly\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. **Use `daemon=True` for background tasks**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   t = threading.Thread(target=background_task, daemon=True)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This ensures the thread stops when the main program exits.\n",
    "3. **Use an Event Flag to Control Thread Execution**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   stop_event = threading.Event()\n",
    "   \n",
    "   def background_task():\n",
    "       while not stop_event.is_set():\n",
    "           print(\"Running...\")\n",
    "           time.sleep(1)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   t = threading.Thread(target=background_task)\n",
    "   t.start()\n",
    "   \n",
    "   time.sleep(3)\n",
    "   stop_event.set()  # Signals the thread to stop\n",
    "   t.join()\n",
    "   print(\"Thread exited cleanly.\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This method allows safe and controlled thread termination.\n",
    "\n",
    "By handling threads properly, you can avoid zombie threads and ensure efficient resource management in Python applications. ðŸš€"
