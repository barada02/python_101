    "### **Introduction to OOP in Python**  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**  \n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of **objects**. These objects contain **data (attributes)** and **methods (functions)** that operate on the data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why Use OOP in Python?**  \n",
    "OOP helps in:  \n",
    "- **Code reusability**: You can reuse existing classes in new programs.  \n",
    "- **Scalability**: It helps in designing large applications efficiently.  \n",
    "- **Encapsulation**: Data is protected inside objects, reducing unintended interference.  \n",
    "- **Abstraction**: Hides unnecessary details and exposes only relevant parts.  \n",
    "- **Polymorphism**: Different objects can share the same interface but behave differently.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Procedural vs. Object-Oriented Programming**  \n",
    "| Feature  | Procedural Programming | Object-Oriented Programming |\n",
    "|----------|-----------------------|----------------------------|\n",
    "| Approach | Follows a sequence of tasks (top-down) | Models real-world entities using objects |\n",
    "| Data Access | Data is globally accessible | Data is encapsulated inside objects |\n",
    "| Code Reusability | Requires copying and modifying functions | Uses inheritance and classes |\n",
    "| Example | Functions operating on global variables | Objects interacting with each other |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key OOP Concepts**  \n",
    "1. **Class** – A blueprint for creating objects.  \n",
    "2. **Object** – An instance of a class.  \n",
    "3. **Encapsulation** – Restricting direct access to some components.  \n",
    "4. **Abstraction** – Hiding complex implementation details.  \n",
    "5. **Inheritance** – One class can derive properties from another.  \n",
    "6. **Polymorphism** – Objects can take multiple forms (e.g., method overriding).  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example: Understanding Objects and Classes**  \n",
    "Here’s a simple real-world analogy:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- A **class** is like a **car blueprint** (defines properties like color, brand, speed).  \n",
    "- An **object** is an **actual car** built using that blueprint.  \n",
    "- Each car (object) has different attributes (color, speed) but follows the same blueprint (class).  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n"
