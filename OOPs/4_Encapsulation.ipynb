    "✅ **Encapsulation** binds data and methods together.  \n",
    "✅ **Public** (`self.var`) → Accessible anywhere.  \n",
    "✅ **Protected** (`self._var`) → Not strictly private, but should be treated as internal.  \n",
    "✅ **Private** (`self.__var`) → Cannot be accessed directly, uses name mangling.  \n",
    "✅ **Getter & Setter methods** ensure **controlled access** to private variables.  \n",
    "✅ `@property` provides a **cleaner way** to implement getters and setters.  \n",
