    "**What is a Recursive Function?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A recursive function is a function that calls itself during its execution.\n",
    "* This allows you to break down complex problems into smaller, self-similar subproblems.\n",
    "* Think of it like a set of nested mirrors, where each reflection contains a smaller version of the original image.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Components:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Every recursive function must have two essential parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Base Case:**\n",
    "    * This is the stopping condition. It determines when the recursion should terminate.\n",
    "    * Without a base case, the function would call itself indefinitely, leading to a \"stack overflow\" error.\n",
    "    * The base case represents the simplest form of the problem, which can be solved directly.\n",
    "2.  **Recursive Case:**\n",
    "    * This is where the function calls itself.\n",
    "    * In each recursive call, the function should work towards the base case by modifying the input in some way.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it Works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  When a recursive function is called, the program pushes a new \"stack frame\" onto the call stack.\n",
    "2.  The stack frame contains the function's local variables and the current state of execution.\n",
    "3.  If the base case is not met, the function calls itself, creating another stack frame.\n",
    "4.  This process continues until the base case is reached.\n",
    "5.  Once the base case is reached, the function returns a value, and the stack frames are popped off the stack in reverse order.\n",
    "6.  As each stack frame is popped, the function's previous state is restored, and the results are combined to produce the final output.\n",

    "* The recursive case is `n * factorial(n - 1)`, which breaks the problem down into smaller factorials."
